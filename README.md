* Clone this repository in your local environment by running the code on your git bash.

`git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Face-Detection.git`

Now, Install the required **packages:**

* `pip install opencv-python`

OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License.

* `pip install mediapipe`

MediaPipe Face Detection is an ultrafast face detection solution that comes with 6 landmarks and multi-face support. It is based on BlazeFace, a lightweight and well-performing face detector tailored for mobile GPU inference. The detectorâ€™s super-realtime performance enables it to be applied to any live viewfinder experience that requires an accurate facial region of interest as an input for other task-specific models, such as 3D facial keypoint estimation (e.g., MediaPipe Face Mesh), facial features or expression classification, and face region segmentation. BlazeFace uses a lightweight feature extraction network inspired by, but distinct from MobileNetV1/V2, a GPU-friendly anchor scheme modified from Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), and an improved tie resolution strategy alternative to non-maximum suppression. For more information about BlazeFace, please see the Resources section.
